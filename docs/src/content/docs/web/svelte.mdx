Svelte is a modern JavaScript framework used for building user interfaces. Unlike traditional frameworks like React or Vue, Svelte shifts much of the work that would typically be done in the browser at runtime to the build process. This means Svelte compiles your components into highly efficient vanilla JavaScript code during build time, eliminating the need for a virtual DOM and improving performance.
