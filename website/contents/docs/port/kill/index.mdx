title: Kill port
description: Managing open ports on your development machine is crucial, especially when switching between projects or debugging port conflicts. Sometimes, a process might still be using a port you need, and restarting your computer isn't always the fastest option.
---

To solve this problem, `dose3` includes a helpful CLI command: `dose kill`.

## CLI

You can use the following command to terminate the process that is using a specific port:

```shell
dose kill {your port}
```

Replace `{your port}` with the actual port number you want to close.

## What is this?

If you're running multiple services and forget which one is using a specific port, or you simply want to free up a port quickly, `dose kill` is here to help.

This command automatically finds the process bound to the given port and terminates it. Here is an example of how it works:

```shell
$ dose kill 3000
  Closed port 3000
```

## Use Cases

- Freeing up ports when switching between projects
- Stopping a development server that didn’t shut down properly
- Cleaning up unused ports before starting new services

## Best Practices

- Make sure you’re not killing critical system processes—use this for development ports only.
- Double-check the port number before running the command.
- Use `dose scan` beforehand if you're not sure which ports are open.
