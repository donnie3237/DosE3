# Scan Port

One of the essential tasks when managing local development environments or debugging network-related issues is checking which ports are currently in use on your machine. Open ports can be used by web servers, databases, background services, or even applications that you might have forgotten are running.

To make this task easier, `dose3` provides a simple command-line tool called `dose scan`.

## Usage

You can use the following command to scan and list all the open ports on your localhost:

```shell
dose scan
```

Once executed, this command will perform a quick and efficient scan of your system and return a list of ports that are currently open and actively listening for connections.

## Sample Result

Here's a sample output you might see after running the `dose scan` command:

```shell
  --> Port 135 is open.
  --> Port 445 is open.
  --> Port 4321 is open.
  --> Port 5040 is open.
  --> Port 5354 is open.
  --> Port 6463 is open.
  --> Port 7680 is open.
  --> Port 8090 is open.
  --> Port 8828 is open.
  --> Port 8829 is open.
  --> Port 25734 is open.
  --> Port 27080 is open.
  --> Port 42050 is open.
  --> Port 49664 is open.
  --> Port 49665 is open.
  --> Port 49666 is open.
  --> Port 49667 is open.
  --> Port 49668 is open.
  --> Port 49679 is open.
  --> Port 50013 is open.
  --> Port 50489 is open.
  --> Port 52778 is open.
  --> Port 53693 is open.
  --> Port 53728 is open.
  --> Port 58825 is open.
  --> Port 60447 is open.
  --> Port 60581 is open.
  --> Port 60805 is open.
  --> Port 63759 is open.
Scan finished!
```

## Why It's Useful

Knowing which ports are open can help you:
- **Identify Conflicts:** If a port required by your application is already in use, `dose scan` can help pinpoint the conflict quickly.
- **Debug Issues:** If a service isnâ€™t reachable, verifying if the port is open is a good first step.
- **Monitor Security:** Unexpected open ports might indicate background processes or services that shouldn't be running.

## Best Practices

- Run this command regularly if you're switching between projects that use different services or environments.
- Use this command alongside tools like `dose kill` (if available) to manage port usage.
- Investigate unfamiliar ports to ensure there are no rogue or unnecessary services consuming system resources.

This feature is part of the growing toolkit within `dose3` to help developers manage local environments more efficiently and with greater visibility.
