title: Think about dose3
description: Imagine this... You're in a world filled with endless programming languages, frameworks, and tools. Every project comes with its own unique requirements, and your job as a developer is to choose the right stack that fits perfectly. But why is it that every time you start a new project, youâ€™re forced to reinvent the wheel? You repeat the same setup, install the same dependencies, and structure your project the same way â€” over and over again.
